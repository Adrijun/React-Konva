# React-Konva

# Canvas rendering board

This is my thesis at the end of my front-end developer class at Medieinstitutet!

# What is this?
The idea of this project was to build a function that retrieves data containing coordinates of persons, boundingboxes and dangerzones.

Following a specific connection scheme with keypoints and using the coordinates,
lines are drawn between each keypoint and eventually you see a person.
Around every person detection there is  a bounding box with a label.


With this function it will now render an image completely anonymously and GDPR compliant

# Used Technologies
Built with React library using TypeScript and React-Konva
